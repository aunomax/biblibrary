We confirm that their comparison methods can be simplified and refined, applicable to seek the critical mass 8π concerning finite-time blow-up in the unit disk. As an application, we deal with a parabolic–elliptic–parabolic chemotaxis model involving indirect signal production in the unit ball of , proposed by Tao and Winkler (2025). Within the framework of radially symmetric solutions, we prove that   
if initial mass is less than , then solution is globally bounded;
   
for any m exceeding , there exist non-negative initial data with prescribed mass m such that the corresponding classical solutions exhibit a formation of Dirac-delta type singularity in finite time, termed a chemotactic collapse.},
