  title            = {1. What Is Applied Mathematics?},
  abstract         = {The purpose of this book is to foster an appreciation of the nature of applied mathematics. We attempt to explain the essential processes involved and to provide experience in applied mathematics as it is used in a variety of physical problems. The book is not intended as a compilation of methods—which cannot be complete in any case. Rather, it is believed that an appreciation of the applied mathematician's approach will provide the student with a clear framework on which to fit his knowledge, and with a creative attitude. These are much more valuable than an encyclopedia of methods. Section 1.1 begins with some fairly detailed remarks on the nature of applied mathematics. Then follows an outline of the applied mathematical topics that are to be presented in this work. Section 1.2 consists of an introduction to the study of galactic structure, and Section 1.3 analyzes the sudden aggregation of a population of amebae. The main purpose of Sections 1.2 and 1.3 is to provide an early feeling for the type of problem now under investigation by applied mathematicians. (The authors selected the topics from among their own current interests.) On first perusal at least, the reader should not concern himself unduly with detail but should concentrate on getting a general impression. The behavior of stars and the behavior of amebae might seem to have little in common. It is an excellent illustration of the power of applied mathematics, however, to realize that this is not the case. For example, we shall see that both stars and amebae behave as if their mass were continuously distributed— notwithstanding the fact that one can see (using a microscope) gaps between amebae, while the nearest stars are light-years apart. But it is of little relevance that an idealized mathematical model such as the continuum is “wrong.” The real question is: Do the errors have a significant effect upon predictions concerning the phenomena under investigation?},

  title            = {2. Deterministic Systems and Ordinary Differential Equations},
  abstract         = {In this chapter we shall illustrate something of the range of applied mathematics using particle dynamics as our central example. The principal purpose of our discussion will be to analyze the process of applied mathematics. We are not primarily interested at this point in enlarging the reader's facility, so a thorough exposition of certain methods will be deferred. We first examine the relation between Kepler's laws, which describe the motion of the planets, and Newton's formulation of the theoretical law of universal gravitation. The orbits of planets and comets are deduced by the rather ingenious classical solution of the governing equations. When relativistic effects are considered, however, attempting to find an exact solution no longer is an optimal procedure. A perturbation method should be used. The same method is called for when one wishes to calculate the relatively small effect of other planets upon a given planet's orbit about the sun. As an illustration of practical calculational procedures that have been devised to fill a definite need, we discuss perturbation theory in a certain amount of detail. Roughly speaking, this theory permits one to calculate the effects of small disturbances on otherwise known situations. Remarkably valuable information can be obtained by sophisticated variants of perturbation theory—one cannot expect its content to be summarized in a few pages. Thus our discussion is a foretaste of what is to come in the remainder of this volume. Particle dynamics is an example of a deterministic process wherein the future is completely determined, given sufficient knowledge of the present. Whether the outcome of such processes is to be calculated in detail or just contemplated philosophically, certain purely mathematical questions arise. We conclude this chapter by stating and proving some relevant theorems. These involve existence, uniqueness, and continuous dependence on a parameter of systems of ordinary differential equations.},

  title            = {3. Random Processes and Partial Differential Equations},
  abstract         = {In Chapter 2 we considered the dynamics of individual particles, and we showed that interaction of the particles can be modeled by a system of ordinary differential equations. Existence of a solution to these equations under prescribed conditions (usually specified values of the initial position and velocity of each particle) is assured by a classical mathematical theory. Actual determination of an adequate approximation to the solution can be carried out, if necessary, by numerical integration. Study of the algorithms used in numerical analysis is necessary to provide assurance that a given approximation is accurate. Nevertheless, mathematical theory assures us of the unique existence of the solution. The future of the particles is completely determined by their past, so our model is deterministic. We shall now study examples of models in which there is uncertainty in the predicted outcome of a process. In such situations we shall refer to random processes; the corresponding models will be termed probabilistic. For example, we shall see that when many particles interact, it is often useful to adopt a model in which each particle's motion is described by certain probabilities. Although we shall give some consideration to random processes for their own sake, our primary goal is to investigate the connection between probabilistic and deterministic models of the same phenomenon. The key fact here is that even though a process is regarded as random, nevertheless in many circumstances we can write down deterministic problems in partial differential equations that yield a definite distribution function for the probabilities associated with the process. The partial differential equation for the distribution function is identical with the equation one would write down in a deterministic characterization of the phenomenon.},

For linear homogeneous problems, the principle of superposition holds; i.e., if special solutions to the problem are known, then a linear combination of such solutions yields new solutions. Furthermore, the solution in the inhomogeneous case can be obtained by a linear combination of solutions to the homogeneous problem and a special solution of the inhomogeneous problem. Perhaps the most important landmark in the development of the basic theory for solving linear problems is the publication in 1822 of Fourier's Théorie Analytique de la Chaleur (Mathematical Theory of Heat). Not only does this book provide an exemplary formal treatment of a general class of “boundary value problems,” but it also serves to initiate the theory of a mathematical approach possessing great generality. In its original and generalized forms, Fourier's approach is indispensable to modern science and engineering. It is one of the most important landmarks in the development of applied mathematics.},

Our treatment followed historical developments closely and serves as a case study to illustrate the role of applied mathematics. In this chapter we shall again make a study in this spirit but at a somewhat deeper level. Once more starting with specific problems, we shall outline theory and methods of wide-ranging applicability and implications. We begin by considering some specific problems of heat conduction. A study of the problem of heat conduction in inhomogeneous media will lead to the discussion of eigenfunctions more general than the harmonic functions. The case of an infinite homogeneous medium will introduce the topic of Fourier integral. It will then be pointed out that the analysis of a time sequence, such as a weather record, may often be conveniently made in terms of Fourier series or integral but that this is not sufficient. There exist time sequences that cannot be so represented. The theory of generalized harmonic analysis is required, and this will be briefly described.},

  title            = {6. Simplification, Dimensional Analysis, and Scaling},
  abstract         = {A number of procedures that are of value to the applied mathematician will be described and illustrated in Part B of this volume. This chapter, the first of six that comprise Part B, is concerned with steps that should be taken to modify a preliminary formulation of a mathematical problem so that it assumes a more manageable character. Section 6.1 deals with the advantages and possible pitfalls of modifying a problem by deleting certain terms, terms which seem to be relatively small and whose deletion makes the problem easier to solve. In Section 2 we show that the use of dimensionless variables reduces the number of parameters which determine the solution of a problem. This is an aspect of dimensional analysis, a straightforward procedure but one that is more subtle and more useful than one first expects. We demonstrate in Section 6.2 that dimensionless variables can be selected in a number of ways, with the same relatively few dimensionless parameters appearing in each case. In Section 6.3 we discuss a particular selection process that gives rise to what are called “scaled” dimensionless variables. When these variables are used in the dimensionless formulation of a problem, the dimensionless parameters that appear acquire added significance: they provide the relative magnitudes of various terms. Consequently, if correctly scaled variables can be chosen (and this is not an easy matter), the problem is often ripe for certain perturbation methods. There are two classes of such methods: the simpler regular perturbation methods (the subject of Chapter 8) or the more complicated singular perturbation methods (Chapter 9). Perturbation methods provide one of the most useful sets of applied mathematical tools. Thus it is well worth devoting some effort to understanding the procedure discussed in Section 6.3, which sets up a problem so that perturbation calculations become somewhat “natural.”},

  title            = {7. Regular Perturbation Theory},
  abstract         = {Given the solution to a certain mathematical problem, how is the solution determined when the conditions of the problem are slightly altered? The systematic answer to this question forms the subject of perturbation theory. Section 2.2 contains some discussion of perturbation theory. In keeping with the broad viewpoint of Part A, the treatment there is not detailed. Its principal purpose is to illustrate how the approach of Poincaré can remove bothersome secular terms that appear in a naïve approach to including the effects of other planets upon the motion of a selected planet about the sun. This is done indirectly, by discussing the effect of small nonlinearity upon the motion of a simple pendulum. We are now in a more favorable situation regarding the study of perturbation theory. This arises through the discussion in Chapter 6 of ways to formulate a mathematical model so that a meaningful small parameter appeared in it (if this is permitted by the conditions of the problem). In the present short chapter, our object is to provide some detailed examination of regular perturbation theory. Roughly speaking, this theory is appropriate when a reasonable initial approximation is obtained by means of a straightforward attempt at simplifying a problem that involves a small parameter. Section 7.1 provides details that were omitted in the treatment of the pendulum problem given in Chapter 2. Section 7.2 illustrates various aspects of regular perturbation calculations on the projectile problem. (The mathematical formulation of this problem was the subject of much detailed discussion in the previous chapter.) In all, three approaches to the calculations will be presented: series, parametric differentiation, and successive approximation. Further application of regular perturbation theory, this time on a more difficult problem involving a pair of ordinary differential equations, is made in Chapter 8. Moreover, Chapter 10 in II contains a lengthy analysis of the use of this theory (with some modifications) in a water wave problem governed by a system of nonlinear partial differential equations. Taken together, all these examples provide a foundation for the use of an important technique.},

The problem will be treated on a sufficiently simple level so that our discussion can be self-contained. In our analysis we shall put to good use a number of the ideas we have studied in simpler contexts—dimensional analysis, scaling, and regular perturbation theory. We shall see how dimensional analysis reduces the number of relevant parameters from eight to three. Part of the scaling is rather challenging. Moreover, the perturbation theory is not entirely straightforward, for there are two important parameters in the problem whose relative magnitudes must be ascertained. In summary, while only involving a pair of first order ordinary differential equations, the model for standing gradient flow that we shall consider is sophisticated enough to require a panoply of our methods for its thorough analysis.},

  title            = {9. Introduction to Singular Perturbation Theory},
  abstract         = {Singular perturbation theory has grown out of attempts to deal with physical problems, the most important of which involves the boundary layer phenomenon in fluid mechanics. The classical instance of this phenomenon occurs in the flow past an object such as an airplane wing. As will be discussed with some care in Chapter 3 of II, the appropriately scaled equations in this case contain the effects of viscosity only in terms multiplied by an extremely small parameter. Yet if these terms are neglected, computations show that the air exerts no drag on the wing. This is D'Alembert's paradox (see Section 15.4). The paradox was resolved early in this century when Ludwig Prandtl showed experimentally and theoretically that however small the viscosity or “stickiness” of the fluid, viscous effects are important in a thin layer near the wing. Prandtl's discovery not only was a breakthrough in the understanding of aerodynamics, but it opened up the investigation, via singular perturbation theory, of how small causes (e.g., small fluid viscosity) can lead to large effects (appreciable drag). It might seem that the practitioner of singular perturbation theory would find relatively few important problems to work on, but this is not at all the case. The abundance of such problems is at least partially explained by the fact that singular perturbation techniques seem to be appropriate for examining the behavior of solutions near their “worst” singularities. “Taking the bull by the horns” and examining functions near their worst singularities is the best way to obtain information about qualitative behavior, and it is elucidation of this behavior that is very often the goal of a theoretician. In this lies the point of a remark once made about a distinguished applied mathematician, “All he can do is singular perturbation problems. But of course he can turn all problems into singular perturbation problems!”},

We shall be led to consider singular perturbation theory for an initial value problem involving a certain system of ordinary differential equations. Some details of the discussion of boundary value problems in Chapter 9 are inapplicable, but the arguments are the same in spirit. The reader's understanding should thus be reinforced. In Section 10.1 we formulate a mathematical problem that describes the course of a chemical reaction catalyzed by an enzyme. We shall consider the frequently occurring case when the initial enzyme concentration is small (in a sense to be made more precise). The problem can then be profitably analyzed with the techniques of singular perturbation theory. This we do in Section 10.2. In particular, we make a technical advance over Chapter 9 by indicating how higher approximations can be obtained.},

  title            = {11. Three Techniques Applied to the Simple Pendulum},
  abstract         = {This chapter contains some brief discussions of certain useful techniques and concepts. All the discussions are centered on the pendulum problem. We have already treated this problem in some detail, but nevertheless, as will be seen, much can be learned from further investigation. From this we draw the general moral that a surprising amount of scientific understanding can be gleaned from an intensive study of a properly selected special problem. In Section 11.1, we investigate the fate of small perturbations to the two possible equilibrium positions of the pendulum, bob upward and bob downward. This provides a simple illustration of the concept of stability, which was briefly introduced in our earlier investigation of ameba aggregation (Section 1.3) and which is taken up again in more detail when we study the stability of density-stratified fluids (Section 15.2). Section 11.2 illustrates the power of the “multiple scale” perturbation method. For the pendulum this method recognizes that there are two time scales, one during which the pendulum executes an oscillation, and a much longer one during which the period of the oscillation changes significantly. The multiple scale or “two-timing” method has recently found application in many contexts. Section 11.3 shows how qualitative understanding of all possible motions of a simple pendulum can be obtained by an analysis of the displacement-angular velocity plane. The damped and undamped pendulum are contrasted. Another method of wide applicability is thereby illustrated, phase plane analysis. The three sections are mutually independent and can be read in any order.},

  title            = {12. Longitudinal Motion of a Bar},
  abstract         = {We now begin the third part of the present volume, a part devoted to the study of basic continuum mechanics. This chapter will be devoted to a discussion of the one-dimensional longitudinal motion of a bar, a physical problem that arises in many different contexts. As we shall see, it is possible to elucidate a number of significant aspects of the phenomena involved, with relatively elementary mathematical techniques. To give one example, an incoming elastic wave doubles its force at a plane where it is reflected (Exercise 12.2.9). There could be dire consequences if this were not anticipated. We have based the development of the basic equations on the same approach that is used in deriving similar results for the three-dimensional continuum. We feel that the general approach is clearer if it is first presented without the complications of three-dimensional geometry. Thus we recommend that at least Section 12.1 be studied before the general material, which begins in Chapter 13. (On the other hand, some will prefer to regard the present chapter as providing a particular illustration of the general theory of continuum mechanics, and this is certainly a feasible procedure.) Many of the specific questions that will be considered are prototypes of similar problems which will be tackled later with more complicated geometries. Such items as wave propagation, reflection and transmission, dispersion, propagation of discontinuities, and free vibrations arise in a natural manner. The mathematical techniques used in studying these can be generalized, although with difficulties at times, so that they apply in two and three dimensions. Our general strategy will be to adopt an optimistic attitude toward obtaining a simple but meaningful one-dimensional formulation of elastic motion. Certain subtleties that a deep discussion would require are not treated here.},

  title            = {13. The Continuous Medium},
  abstract         = {Historic moments usually culminate one long series of events and begin another. One such moment came in 1687 with the publication of Newton's Principia. Dramatically positioned at the head of Book 1 were the three laws. I. Every body continues in its state of rest, or of uniform motion straight ahead, unless it be compelled to change that state by forces impressed upon it. II. The change of motion is proportional to the motive force impressed, and it takes place along the right line in which that force is impressed. III. To an action there is always a contrary and equal reaction, or, the mutual actions of two bodies upon each other are always equal and directed to contrary parts. By taut and clear deductions from these laws Newton summed up a century's work on the motion of one or two bodies in a vacuum. “What Newton writes is correct, clear, and short. In earlier works the brilliant diamonds of discovery lie concealed in an opaque matrix of wordy special cases, laborious details, metaphysics, confusion, and error; while Newton follows a vein of pure gold.” Unlike his work on the one and two body problems, Newton's work on the three body problem was not centered on the formulation and solution of the governing differential equations. Indeed “he shows no sign of an attempt to set up equations of motion. That he obtained some correct inequalities and groped his way to the major approximate results under this handicap is one more tribute to his peerless grasp of the physical essence of mechanics and to the might of his brain. It does not show, however, that his formulation of the general laws of mechanics was adequate. History proves the contrary.” Further progress on the three body problem required formulation of the general equations of celestial mechanics and these equations were not published until 1749 (by Euler).},

  title            = {14. Field Equations of Continuum Mechanics},
  abstract         = {In this chapter we shall provide careful derivations of the field equations that restrict the behavior of any continuous medium. These equations express conservation of mass, and balance of linear momentum, of angular momentum, and of energy. In addition there are Gibbs relations, which couple heat flow with entropy and temperature, and couple work done with pressure and volume. Finally, there is an entropy inequality. Only “ordinary” mechanical effects will be considered—electrical, magnetic, and chemical effects will be ignored. In the concluding section of the chapter we give a short discussion of a topic to be taken up much more fully in the remainder of the book, the different constitutive equations that distinguish different media. It is important to bear in mind that such equations (indeed, all physically meaningful equations) must not differ essentially if a new coordinate system is employed. This matter is discussed briefly, although it is only taken up fully in II. We conclude with a few additional remarks on the validity of the continuum model.},

  title            = {15. Inviscid Fluid Flow},
  abstract         = {As was discussed in Section 14.5, the field equations describe properties, such as conservation of mass, which are common to all continua, whereas constitutive equations describe the qualities that distinguish one particular kind of continuum from another. We begin this chapter with a discussion of one of the simplest constitutive equations, the one for an inviscid or perfect fluid. (As we shall see, this equation holds for all fluids when there is no motion.) We then turn to the formulation and solution of some specific problems and thus begin to understand the power and defects of the inviscid fluid model. The first specific class of problems treated deals with the fate of small disturbances to a quiescent horizontal fluid layer whose density varies with height. The important concept of stability is introduced, the technique of linearization is used, and the resulting eigenvalue problems are examined for qualitative behavior or are solved in special cases. We see that the inviscid model provides reasonable predictions for situations of physical interest. We next consider compression waves in gases. Our discussion touches on small-amplitude sound waves and large-amplitude shock waves. We encounter solutions to the linearized wave equation which propagate without changing shape, and we examine deforming simple wave solutions to the appropriate system of nonlinear partial differential equations. Solutions of the latter type develop such rapid variation that virtually discontinuous shock waves result. All these predicted flows are well verified experimentally. Finally, we employ separation of variables to find a two-dimensional flow of a uniform stream past a circular cylinder. This flow does not seem in accord with experience, for a calculation indicates that the net drag force on the cylinder is zero. Further investigation shows that the same result holds for the flow of a uniform stream past quite general bodies. For this problem, then, the inviscid model does not seem satisfactory. A discussion of how viscous forces cause drag is a central motif of Chapter 3 in II.},

  abstract         = {The theory of gravitational potential, and its extension to the theory of electrostatics and to electromagnetic and sound waves, provides fine examples of the power of mathematical analysis. It also gives rise to a number of very subtle and challenging problems. In this chapter we shall discuss a few of the highlights of this subject to give a reader a feeling of the breadth of its implications and ramifications. In Section 16.1, using the gravitational potential for motivation, we derive various results for the equations of Laplace and Poisson. Section 16.2 deals primarily with the construction and use of Green's functions; electrostatics provides physical background. The final section treats an inviscid flow problem that reduces to Helmholtz's equation: the problem of the diffraction of planar sound waves impinging on a hole in a screen.},

  abstract         = {Eukaryotic cells perform chemotaxis by determining the direction of chemical gradients based on stochastic sensing of concentrations at the cell surface. To examine the efficiency of this process, previous studies have investigated the limit of estimation accuracy for gradients. However, these studies assume that the cell shape and gradient are constant, and do not consider how adaptive regulation of cell shape affects the estimation limit. Dynamics of cell shape during gradient sensing is biologically ubiquitous and can influence the estimation by altering the way the concentration is measured, and cells may strategically regulate their shape to improve estimation accuracy. To address this gap, we investigate the estimation limits in dynamic situations where cells change shape adaptively depending on the sensed signal. We approach this problem by analyzing the stationary solution of the Bayesian nonlinear filtering equation. By applying diffusion approximation to the ligand-receptor binding process and the Laplace method for the posterior expectation under a high signal-to-noise ratio regime, we obtain an analytical expression for the estimation limit. This expression indicates that estimation accuracy can be improved by elongating perpendicular to the estimated direction, which is also confirmed by numerical simulations. Our analysis provides a basis for clarifying the interplay between estimation and control in gradient sensing and sheds light on how cells optimize their shape to enhance chemotactic efficiency.},

  abstract         = {Biology is data-rich, and it is equally rich in concepts and hypotheses. Part of trying to understand biological processes and systems is therefore to confront our ideas and hypotheses with data using statistical methods to determine the extent to which our hypotheses agree with reality. But doing so in a systematic way is becoming increasingly challenging as our hypotheses become more detailed, and our data becomes more complex. Mathematical methods are therefore gaining in importance across the life- and biomedical sciences. Mathematical models allow us to test our understanding, make testable predictions about future behaviour, and gain insights into how we can control the behaviour of biological systems. It has been argued that mathematical methods can be of great benefit to biologists to make sense of data. But mathematics and mathematicians are set to benefit equally from considering the often bewildering complexity inherent to living systems. Here we present a small selection of open problems and challenges in mathematical biology. We have chosen these open problems because they are of both biological and mathematical interest.},
