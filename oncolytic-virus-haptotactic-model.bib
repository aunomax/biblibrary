  abstract  = {Vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) selectively replicates in tumor but not in normal cells and is being developed as an oncolytic agent for cancer therapy. Here we report the construction of a recombinant VSV capable of inducing syncytia formation between tumor cells through membrane fusion at neutral pH, which led to enhanced oncolytic properties against multifocal hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in the livers of immunocompetent rats. Recombinant VSV vectors were constructed by insertion into their genome a transcription unit expressing a control or fusion protein derived from Newcastle disease virus. In vitro characterization of the recombinant fusogenic VSV vector on human and rat HCC cells showed extensive syncytia formation and significantly enhanced cytotoxic effects. In vivo, administration of fusogenic VSV into the hepatic artery of Buffalo rats bearing syngeneic multifocal HCC lesions in their livers resulted in syncytia formation exclusively within the tumors, and there was no collateral damage to the neighboring hepatic parenchyma. The fusogenic VSV also conferred a significant survival advantage over a nonfusogenic control virus in the treated animals (P = 0.0078, log-rank test). The results suggest that fusogenic VSV can be developed into an effective and safe therapeutic agent for cancer treatment in patients, including those with multifocal HCC in the liver. {\textcopyright}2004 American Association for Cancer Research.},

  abstract = {Since the turn of the nineteenth century, when their existence was first recognized, viruses have attracted considerable interest as possible agents of tumor destruction. Early case reports emphasized regression of cancers during naturally acquired virus infections, providing the basis for clinical trials where body fluids containing human or animal viruses were used to transmit infections to cancer patients. Most often the viruses were arrested by the host immune system and failed to impact tumor growth, but sometimes, in immunosuppressed patients, infection persisted and tumors regressed, although morbidity as a result of the infection of normal tissues was unacceptable. With the advent of rodent models and new methods for virus propagation, there were numerous attempts through the 1950s and 1960s to force the evolution of viruses with greater tumor specificity, but success was limited and many researchers abandoned the field. Technology employing reverse genetics later brought about a renewal of interest in virotherapy that allowed the generation of more potent, tumor-specific oncolytics. Here, examination of early oncolytic virotherapy before genetic engineering serves to highlight tremendous advances, yet also hints at ways to penetrate host immune defenses, a significant remaining challenge in modern virotherapy research.},

When posed under no-flux boundary conditions in a smoothly bounded domain Ω ⊂ R2, with positive parameters Dw, Dz and β, and along with initial conditions involving suitably regular data, this system is known to admit global classical solutions. It is shown that with respect to infinite-time blow-up, this system exhibits a critical mass phenomenon related to the quantity mc := 1/(β−1)+: In fact, it is seen that each solution fulfilling 1/|Ω| ∫Ωu(⋅,0) > mc must be unbounded, and this is complemented by a boundedness result which inter alia asserts that for any choice of m < mc one can find a nontrivial set of solutions, particularly containing spatially heterogeneous solutions, each of which is bounded though satisfying 1/|Ω| ∫Ωu(⋅,0) > m.
