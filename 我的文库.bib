biological or medical phenomena including bacterial chemotactic motion, initiation of angiogenesis and reinforced random walks. 
The survey is focused on the existence, wave speed, asymptotic decay rates, stability and chemical diffusion limits of traveling wave solutions. 
The main approaches are reviewed and related analytical results are given with sketchy proofs. We also develop some new results with detailed proofs to fill the gap existing in the literature. The numerical simulations of steadily propagating waves will be presented along the study. Open problems are proposed for interested readers to pursue.},

In an earlier work (Rachidi et al., 2017) by the authors of the current paper, traveling wave solutions of the above chemotaxis system with τ=0 are studied. It is shown in Rachidi et al.

Linearising around the travelling wave solutions, we locate the essential and absolute spectrum of the associated linear operators and find that all travelling wave solutions have parts of the essential spectrum in the right half plane. However, we show that in the case of constant or sublinear consumption there exists a range of parameters such that the absolute spectrum is contained in the open left half plane and the essential spectrum can thus be weighted into the open left half plane. For the constant and sublinear consumption rate models we also determine critical parameter values for which the absolute spectrum crosses into the right half plane, indicating the onset of an absolute instability of the travelling wave solution. We observe that this crossing always occurs off of the real axis.},

When the initial datum is a continuous small perturbation with zero integral from the spatially shifted traveling wave, the asymptotic stability of the large-amplitude (strong) traveling waves has been established in a series of works [29], [34], [35] by the second author with his collaborators. In this paper, we shall show that similar stability results indeed hold true for large and discontinuous initial data (i.e. the initial perturbation from the traveling wave could be discontinuous and has large oscillations) such as Riemann data with large jumps. To the best of our knowledge, this paper provides a first result on the asymptotic stability of large-amplitude traveling waves with large initial perturbation for a system of conservation laws, although similar results have been available for the scalar equations (cf. [8], [42]). We also extend existing results to the initial data with lower regularity.},

	abstract = {The global-in-time existence of bounded weak solutions to a large class of physically relevant, strongly coupled parabolic systems exhibiting a formal gradient-flow structure is proved. The main feature of these systems is that the diffusion matrix may be generally neither symmetric nor positive semi-definite. The key idea is to employ a transformation of variables, determined by the entropy density, which is defined by the gradient-flow formulation. The transformation yields at the same time a positive semi-definite diffusion matrix, suitable gradient estimates as well as lower and/or upper bounds of the solutions. These bounds are a consequence of the transformation of variables and are obtained without the use of a maximum principle. Several classes of cross-diffusion systems are identified which can be solved by this technique. The systems are formally derived from continuous-time random walks on a lattice modeling, for instance, the motion of ions, cells, or fluid particles. The key conditions for this approach are identified and previous results in the literature are unified and generalized. New existence results are obtained for the population model with or without volume filling.},

	abstract = {Hybrid models of chemotaxis combine agent-based models of cells with partial differential equation models of extracellular chemical signals. In this paper, travelling wave properties of hybrid models of bacterial chemotaxis are investigated. Bacteria are modelled using an agent-based (individual-based) approach with internal dynamics describing signal transduction. In addition to the chemotactic behaviour of the bacteria, the individual-based model also includes cell proliferation and death. Cells consume the extracellular nutrient field (chemoattractant) which is modelled using a partial differential equation. Mesoscopic and macroscopic equations representing the behaviour of the hybrid model are derived and the existence of travelling wave solutions for these models is established. It is shown that cell proliferation is necessary for the existence of non-transient (stationary) travelling waves in hybrid models. Additionally, a numerical comparison between the wave speeds of the continuum models and the hybrid models shows good agreement in the case of weak chemotaxis and qualitative agreement for the strong chemotaxis case. In the case of slow cell adaptation, we detect oscillating behaviour of the wave, which cannot be explained by mean-field approximations.},

We have proposed to study this question in the framework of the hyperbolic Keller-Segel system with logistic sensitivity. This is a model system motivated by experiments on cell communities auto-organization, a field which is also called socio-biology. We continue earlier modeling work, where we have shown numerically that branching patterns arise for this system and we have analyzed this instability by formal asymptotics for small diffusivity of the chemo-repellent. Here we are interested in the more general situation, where the diffusivities of both the chemo-attractant and the chemo-repellent are positive. To do so, we develop an appropriate functional analysis framework. We apply our method to two cases. Firstly we analyze steady states. Secondly we analyze traveling waves when neglecting the degradation coefficient of the chemo-repellent; the unique wave speed appears through a singularity cancelation which is the main theoretical difficulty. This shows that in different situations the cell density takes the shape of a plateau. The existence of steady states and traveling plateaus are a symptom of how rich the system is and why branching instabilities can occur. Numerical tests show that large plateaus may split into smaller ones, which remain stable.},

Here, D is supposed to be smooth positive function satisfying D(u)≥CD(u+1)m−1 for all u≥0 with some CD,m{\textgreater}0.

The results of this paper extends the results of Jin (J. Differential Equations 263 (9) (2017) 5759–5772), who proved the possibility of boundness of weak solutions, in the case m{\textgreater}1 and N=3. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first result which gives the relationship between m and μχ that yields to the boundedness of the solution.},

	abstract = {This paper is devoted to investigating the pattern formation of a volume-filling chemotaxis model with logistic cell growth. We first apply the local stability analysis to establish sufficient conditions of destabilization for the uniform steady-state solution. Then, the weakly nonlinear analysis with multi-scales is used to deal with the emerging process of patterns near the bifurcation point. For the single unstable mode case, we derive the Stuart–Landau equations describing the evolution of the amplitude, and thus the asymptotic expressions of patterns are obtained in both supercritical case and subcritical case. While for the case of multiple unstable modes, we also derive coupled amplitude equations to study the competitive behavior between two unstable modes through the phase plane analysis. In particular, we find that the initial data play a dominant role in the competition. All the theoretical and numerical results are in excellently qualitative agreement and better quantitative agreement than that in [10]. Moreover, in the subcritical case, we confirm the existence of stationary patterns with larger amplitudes when the bifurcation parameter is less than the first bifurcation point, which gives an positive answer to the open problem proposed in [9].},

It is moreover shown that if in addition r{\textgreater}0 is sufficiently large then all these solutions are uniformly bounded. A main step in the derivation of these results consists of establishing appropriate positive a priori bounds from below for the mass functional ∫Ωu, which due to the presence of logistic kinetics is not preserved.

Résumé
Dans cet article, nous étudions le système parabolique de Keller–Segel\{\vphantom{\}}ut=∇⋅(∇u−um∇v)dans Ω×(0,T),Γvt=Δv−λv+udans Ω×(0,T), avec Ω un domaine de RN, N⩾1, où m,Γ{\textgreater}0, λ⩾0 sont des constantes et T{\textgreater}0. Lorsque Ω≠RN, les conditions aux limites de Neumann sont prescrites sur le bord. Sous des hypothèses convenables, nous prouvons la non-dégénérescence locale des points d'explosion. Ce résultat semble nouveau même dans le cas du système de Keller–Segel classique (m=1). Des estimations inférieures globales de la vitesse d'explosion sont également obtenues. Dans le cas singulier 0{\textless}m{\textless}1, nous établissons les propriétés nécessaires d'existence locale et de régularité.},

	abstract = {Oncolytic viruses (OV) are viruses that can replicate selectively within cancer cells and destroy them. While the past few decades have seen significant progress related to the use of these viruses in clinical contexts, the success of oncolytic therapies is dampened by the complex spatial tumour-OV interactions. In this work, we present a novel multiscale moving boundary modelling for the tumour-OV interactions, which is based on coupled systems of partial differential equations both at macro-scale (tissue-scale) and at micro-scale (cell-scale) that are connected through a double feedback link. At the macro-scale, we account for the coupled dynamics of uninfected cancer cells, OV-infected cancer cells, extracellular matrix (ECM) and oncolytic viruses. At the same time, at the micro scale, we focus on essential dynamics of urokinase plasminogen activator (uPA) system which is one of the important proteolytic systems responsible for the degradation of the ECM, with notable influence in cancer invasion. While sourced by the cancer cells that arrive during their macro-dynamics within the outer proliferating rim of the tumour, the uPA micro-dynamics is crucial in determining the movement of the macro-scale tumour boundary (both in terms of direction and displacement magnitude). In this investigation, we consider three scenarios for the macro-scale tumour-OV interactions. While assuming the usual context of reaction-diffusion-taxis coupled PDEs, the three macro-dynamics scenarios gradually explore the influence of the ECM taxis over the tumour - OV interaction, in the form of haptotaxis of both uninfected and infected cells populations as well as the indirect ECM taxis for the oncolytic virus. Finally, the complex tumour-OV interactions is investigated numerically through the development a new multiscale moving boundary computational framework. While further investigation is needed to validate the findings of our modelling, for the parameter regimes that we considered, our numerical simulations indicate that the viral therapy leads to control and decrease of the overall cancer expansion and in certain cases this can result even in the elimination of the tumour.},

Here, Ω⊂R2 is a bounded domain with smooth boundary, and χ, ξ, μ and η are positive parameters. As compared to previous mathematical studies, the novelty here consists of allowing for positive values of η, reflecting processes of self-remodeling of the extracellular matrix. Under zero-flux boundary conditions, it is shown that for any sufficiently smooth initial data (u0,w0) satisfying first-order compatibility conditions, the model admits a unique global smooth solution. A crucial ingredient in the proof is an energy-like inequality which, given T{\textgreater}0, yields boundedness of u(⋅,t) in LlogL(Ω). This serves as a starting point for a bootstrap argument used to derive higher regularity estimates sufficient for global extensibility of solutions.},

The model consists of a parabolic chemotaxis-haptotaxis partial differential equation (PDE) describing the evolution of tumor cell density, an elliptic PDE governing the evolution of proteolytic enzyme concentration, and an ordinary differential equation (ODE) modeling the proteolysis of extracellular matrix. In three space dimensions, the existence, uniqueness, and uniform-in-time boundedness of global classical solutions to the above system is proved for large \${\textbackslash}mu{\textgreater}0\$ by raising the a priori estimate of a solution from \$L{\textasciicircum}1({\textbackslash}Omega)\$ to \$L{\textasciicircum}2({\textbackslash}Omega)\$ and then to \$L{\textasciicircum}4({\textbackslash}Omega)\$; in two space dimensions, the existence, uniqueness, and boundedness is proved for any \${\textbackslash}mu {\textgreater}0\$ by raising the a priori estimate of a solution in the following way: \$L{\textasciicircum}1({\textbackslash}Omega){\textbackslash}rightarrow L{\textasciicircum}3(Q\_T){\textbackslash}rightarrow L{\textasciicircum}2({\textbackslash}Omega){\textbackslash}rightarrow L{\textasciicircum}4(Q\_T){\textbackslash}rightarrow L{\textasciicircum}3({\textbackslash}Omega)\$.

	abstract = {Oncolytic viral therapies is one of the new promising strategies against cancer, due to the ability of oncolytic viruses to specifically replicate inside cancer cells and kill them. There is increasing evidence that a sub-class of viruses that contain fusion proteins (triggering the formation of syncytia) can lead to better oncolytic results. Since the details of the tumour dynamics following syncytia formation are not fully understood, in this study we consider a modelling and computational approach to describe the effect of a fusogenic oncolytic virus on the multiscale dynamics of a spreading tumour. We show that for the baseline parameter values considered here, small syncytia diffusion coefficient leads to tumour reduction. Further tumour reduction can be obtained when we increase the probability of syncytia formation, in the context of different viral burst rates and death rates for individually-infected tumour cells and syncytia structures. Finally, we show that the type of syncytia diffusion coefficient (i.e., constant or density dependent) also impacts the outcome of the oncolytic viral therapy.},

	volume = {8},
	doi = {10.3390/math8091464},
	abstract = {Chemotaxis is an oriented movement of cells and organisms in response to chemical signals, and plays an important role in the life of many cells and microorganisms, such as the transport of embryonic cells to developing tissues and immune cells to infection sites. Since the pioneering works of Keller and Segel, there has been a great deal of literature on the qualitative analysis of chemotaxis systems. As an important extension of the Keller-Segel system, a variety of chemotaxis-haptotaxis models have been proposed in order to gain a comprehensive understanding of the invasion-metastasis cascade. From a mathematical point of view, the rigorous analysis thereof is a nontrivial issue due to the fact that partial differential equations (PDEs) for the quantities on the macroscale are strongly coupled with ordinary differential equations (ODEs) modeling the subcellular events. It is the goal of this paper to describe recent results of some chemotaxis-haptotaxis models, inter alia macro cancer invasion models proposed by Chaplain et al., and multiscale cancer invasion models by Stinner et al., and also to introduce some open problems. © 2020 by the authors.},

The detection of blow-up is accomplished by analyzing a relative of the well-known Keller–Segel energy inequality, involving a modification of the corresponding energy functional which, unlike the latter, can be seen to be favourably controlled from below by the corresponding dissipation rate through a certain functional inequality along trajectories.},

Although the mechanism of cancer cell lysis was unknown in the early years of development, advances in tumor biology, molecular biology, and virology have been critical for numerous advances that have brought the field to where it is today. Oncolytic viruses have been developed based on innate and engineered properties to preferentially target tumor cells. Engineered properties include alterations in endogenous gene expression and introduction of foreign genes. Methods to non-invasively monitor sites of viral replication is required for preclinical and clinical studies. Positron emission tomography (PET) can be used for this purpose. This review focuses on commonly used oncolytic viruses, their selection for oncolytic therapy, the design of HSV-1 viral mutants, and monitoring their replication by PET.},

Responses were rare and short-lived. Immune rejection of the oncolytic viruses was identified as the major problem and virotherapy was abandoned. During the past two decades virotherapy has re-emerged with engineered viruses, with a trend towards using them as tumor-debulking immunostimulatory agents combined with radio or chemotherapy. Currently, oncolytic Reovirus, Herpes, and Vaccinia virus are in late phase clinical trials. Despite the renewed hope, efficacy will require improving systemic tumor targeting, overcoming stroma barriers for virus spread, and selectively stimulating immune responses against tumor antigens but not against the virus.

	abstract = {Since the turn of the nineteenth century, when their existence was first recognized, viruses have attracted considerable interest as possible agents of tumor destruction. Early case reports emphasized regression of cancers during naturally acquired virus infections, providing the basis for clinical trials where body fluids containing human or animal viruses were used to transmit infections to cancer patients. Most often the viruses were arrested by the host immune system and failed to impact tumor growth, but sometimes, in immunosuppressed patients, infection persisted and tumors regressed, although morbidity as a result of the infection of normal tissues was unacceptable. With the advent of rodent models and new methods for virus propagation, there were numerous attempts through the 1950s and 1960s to force the evolution of viruses with greater tumor specificity, but success was limited and many researchers abandoned the field. Technology employing reverse genetics later brought about a renewal of interest in virotherapy that allowed the generation of more potent, tumor-specific oncolytics. Here, examination of early oncolytic virotherapy before genetic engineering serves to highlight tremendous advances, yet also hints at ways to penetrate host immune defenses, a significant remaining challenge in modern virotherapy research.},

Their ability to specifically infect and efficiently kill tumor cells, while breaking immune tolerance and mediating immune responses directed against the tumor, make oncolytic viruses highly attractive candidates for immunotherapy. Increasing evidence indicates that a subclass of oncolytic viruses, which encodes for fusion proteins, could outperform non-fusogenic viruses, both in their direct oncolytic potential, as well as their immune-stimulatory properties. Tumor cell infection with these viruses leads to characteristic syncytia formation and cell death due to fusion, as infected cells become fused with neighboring cells, which promotes intratumoral spread of the infection and releases additional immunogenic signals. In this review, we discuss the potential of fusogenic oncolytic viruses as optimal candidates to enhance immunotherapy and initiate broad antitumor responses. We provide an overview of the cytopathic mechanism of syncytia formation through viral-mediated expression of fusion proteins, either endogenous or engineered, and their benefits for cancer therapy. Growing evidence indicates that fusogenicity could be an important feature to consider in the design of optimal oncolytic virus platforms for combinatorial oncolytic immunotherapy.},

Here we report the construction of a recombinant VSV capable of inducing syncytia formation between tumor cells through membrane fusion at neutral pH, which led to enhanced oncolytic properties against multifocal hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in the livers of immunocompetent rats. Recombinant VSV vectors were constructed by insertion into their genome a transcription unit expressing a control or fusion protein derived from Newcastle disease virus. In vitro characterization of the recombinant fusogenic VSV vector on human and rat HCC cells showed extensive syncytia formation and significantly enhanced cytotoxic effects. In vivo, administration of fusogenic VSV into the hepatic artery of Buffalo rats bearing syngeneic multifocal HCC lesions in their livers resulted in syncytia formation exclusively within the tumors, and there was no collateral damage to the neighboring hepatic parenchyma. The fusogenic VSV also conferred a significant survival advantage over a nonfusogenic control virus in the treated animals (P = 0.0078, log-rank test). The results suggest that fusogenic VSV can be developed into an effective and safe therapeutic agent for cancer treatment in patients, including those with multifocal HCC in the liver.},

We consider a more realistic scenario which takes into account the flow of the ambient environment induced by harmonic potentials, and thus retain the identical elliptic structure as in the original PKS. Surprisingly, we find that already the simplest case of linear stationary vector field, \$\$\{Ax{\textasciicircum}{\textbackslash}top\}\$\$Ax⊤, with large enough amplitude \$\$\{A\}\$\$A, prevents chemotactic blow-up. Specifically, the presence of such an ambient fluid transport creates what we call a ‘fast splitting scenario’, which competes with the focusing effect of aggregation so that ‘enough mass’ is pushed away from concentration along the \$\$\{x\_1\}\$\$x1-axis, thus avoiding a finite time blow-up, at least for \$\$\{M  {\textless} 16{\textbackslash}pi\}\$\$M{\textless}16π.

	abstract = {We consider the system(0.1)\{\vphantom{\}}ut=(d(x)u)xx−(d(x)uwx)x,wt=−ug(w), which arises as a simple model for haptotactic migration in heterogeneous environments, such as typically occurring in the invasive dynamics of glioma. A particular focus is on situations when the diffusion herein is degenerate in the sense that the zero set of d is not empty. It is shown that if such possibly present degeneracies are sufficiently mild in the sense that(0.2)∫Ω1d{\textless}∞, then under appropriate assumptions on the initial data a corresponding initial-boundary value problem for (0.1), posed under no-flux boundary conditions in a bounded open interval Ω⊂R, possesses at least one globally defined generalized solution. Moreover, despite such degeneracies the myopic diffusion mechanism in (0.1) is seen to asymptotically determine the solution behavior in the sense that for some constant μ∞{\textgreater}0, the obtained solution satisfies(0.3)u(⋅,t)⇀μ∞din L1(Ω)andw(⋅,t)→0in L∞(Ω)as t→∞, and that hence in the degenerate case the solution component u stabilizes toward a state involving infinite densities, which is in good accordance with experimentally observed phenomena of cell aggregation. Finally, under slightly stronger hypotheses inter alia requiring that 1d belong to Llog⁡L(Ω), a substantial effect of diffusion is shown to appear already immediately by proving that for a.e. t{\textgreater}0, the quantity ln⁡(du(⋅,t)) is bounded in Ω. In degenerate situations, this particularly implies that the blow-up phenomena expressed in (0.3) in fact occur instantaneously.
Résumé
Nous consiérons le système(0.1)\{\vphantom{\}}ut=(d(x)u)xx−(d(x)uwx)x,wt=−ug(w), qui est issu d'un modèle simplifié pour la migration hapto-tactique dans des milieux hétérogènes, comme par exemple dans la dynamique invasive des gliomes. Un intérêt particulier est porté aux situations pour lesquelles la diffusion est dégénérée, c'est-à-dire que le noyau de d est non vide. À (0.1) on peut faire correspondre un problème aux limites, posé sur intervalle ouvert et borné Ω⊂R, associé à une condition de flux nul au bord. Il est montré que si les éventuelles dégénérescences de d sont suffisament modérées au sens que(0.2)∫Ω1d{\textless}∞, alors il existe au moins une solution généralisée au problème, définie globalement. Ce, sous des hypothèses appropriées sur la donnée initiale. De plus, malgré ces dégénérescences, le mécanisme de diffusion myopique de (0.1) determine le comportement asymptotique de la solution. Plus précisément, pour une certaine constante μ∞{\textgreater}0, la solution obtenue satisfait(0.3)u(⋅,t)⇀μ∞ddans L1(Ω)etw(⋅,t)→0dans L∞(Ω)pour t→∞. Donc dans le cas dégénéré, la composante u de la solution converge vers un état présentant des densités infinies. Ceci est en adéquation avec les phénomènes d'aggrégation cellulaire observés expérimentalement. Finalement, sous des hypothèses un peu plus fortes, dont la contrainte d∈Llog⁡L(Ω), il est montré que la diffusion a un effet presque immédiat. C'est-à-dire que pour presque tout t{\textgreater}0, la quantité ln⁡(du(⋅,t)) est bornée dans Ω. Dans le cas dégénéré, ceci implique en particulier que les phénomènes d'explosion décrits par (0.3) ont lieu instantanément.},

This model was proposed by Franssen et al. [7] to characterize the invasion and metastatic spread of cancer cells. We first establish the global existence of uniformly bounded global strong solutions. Then using the decay of ECM and the positivity of MDE, we further improve the regularity of obtained solutions, and achieve the uniform boundedness of solutions in the classical sense. Subsequently, we also prove the uniqueness of solutions. After that, we turn our attention to the large time behavior of solutions, and show that the global classical solution strongly converges to a semi-trivial steady state in the large time limit.},

  abstract = {This paper proposes a survey and critical analysis focused on a variety of chemotaxis models in biology, namely the classical Keller–Segel model and its subsequent modifications, which, in several cases, have been developed to obtain models that prevent the non-physical blow up of solutions. The presentation is organized in three parts. The first part focuses on a survey of some sample models, namely the original model and some of its developments, such as flux limited models, or models derived according to similar concepts. The second part is devoted to the qualitative analysis of analytic problems, such as the existence of solutions, blow-up and asymptotic behavior. The third part deals with the derivation of macroscopic models from the underlying description, delivered by means of kinetic theory methods. This approach leads to the derivation of classical models as well as that of new models, which might deserve attention as far as the related analytic problems are concerned. Finally, an overview of the entire contents leads to suggestions for future research activities.},

  abstract = {We consider the inverse problem of determining two non-constant coeﬃcients in a nonlinear parabolic equation of the Fisher-Kolmogorov-PetrovskyPiskunov type. For the equation ut = D∆u + µ(x) u − γ(x)u2 in (0, T ) × Ω, which corresponds to a classical model of population dynamics in a bounded heterogeneous environment, our results give a stability inequality between the couple of coeﬃcients (µ, γ) and some observations of the solution u. These observations consist in measurements of u: in the whole domain Ω at two ﬁxed times; in a subset ω ⊂⊂ Ω during a ﬁnite time interval; and on the boundary of Ω at all times t ∈ (0, T ). The proof relies on parabolic estimates together with parabolic maximum principle and Hopf’s lemma which enable us to use a Carleman inequality. This work extends previous studies on stable determination of non-constant coeﬃcients in parabolic equations, as it deals with two coeﬃcients and with a nonlinear term. A consequence of our results is the uniqueness of the couple of coeﬃcients (µ, γ), given the observation of u. This uniqueness result was obtained in a previous article but in the one-dimensional case only.},

The model has been proposed in [G. Meral, C. Stinner, and C. Surulescu, On a Multiscale Model Involving Cell Contractivity and its Effects on Tumor Invasion, preprint, TU Kaiserslautern, Kaiserslautern, Germany, 2013] and accounts on the macroscopic level for the evolution of cell and tissue densities, along with the concentration of a chemoattractant, while on the subcellular level it involves the binding of integrins to soluble and insoluble components of the peritumoral region. The connection between the two scales is realized with the aid of a contractivity function characterizing the ability of the tumor cells to adapt their motility behavior to their subcellular dynamics. The resulting system, consisting of three partial and three ordinary differential equations including a temporal delay, in particular involves chemotactic and haptotactic cross diffusion. In order to overcome technical obstacles stemming from the corresponding highest-order interaction terms, we base our analysis on a certain functional, inter alia involving the cell and tissue densities in the diffusion and haptotaxis terms, respectively, which is shown to enjoy a quasi-dissipative property. This will be used as a starting point for the derivation of a series of integral estimates finally allowing for the construction of a generalized solution as the limit of solutions to suitably regularized problems.},

  abstract = {The reaction-diffusion equation is one of the possible ways for modeling animal movement, where the reactive part stands for the population growth and the diffusive part for random dispersal of the population. However, a reaction-diffusion model may not represent all aspects of the spatial dynamics, because of the existence of distinct mechanisms that can affect the movement, such as spatial memory, which results in a bias for one direction of dispersal. This bias is modeled through an advective term on an advection-reaction-diffusion equation. Thus, considering the effects of memory on the population spread, we propose a model composed of a coupled partial differential equation system with two equations: one for the population dynamics and the other for the memory density distribution. For the population growth, we use either the exponential or logistic growth function. The analytic approach shows that for the exponential and logistic growth, the minimum traveling wave speeds are the same with or without memory dynamics in which the variation of memory is infinitesimal. From the numerical analysis, we explore how our parameters, memory, growth rate, and carrying capacity, affect the population redistribution. The combinations of these parameters result in a redistribution pattern of the population associated with either diffusive or superdiffusive and imply the dispersal is faster than the diffusion. Further, in the parameter-space defined by memory and growth rate, we have shown that memory is a factor that switches the dynamics between two spreading behaviors, one faster than the other.},

The system consists of a parabolic equation describing cancer cell migration arising from a combination of chemotaxis and haptotaxis, a parabolic/elliptic equation describing the dynamics of matrix degrading enzymes (MDEs), and an ODE describing the evolution and re-modeling of the extracellular matrix (ECM). We point out that this strongly coupled PDE–ODE setup presents new mathematical difficulties, which are overcome by developing new integral estimate techniques. We prove that the system admits a unique global classical solution which is uniformly bounded in time in the two-dimensional spatial setting at all cancer cell proliferation rates. We also prove that, in the case of three-dimensional convex spatial domain, when cancer cell proliferation is suitably small, the system also possesses a unique classical solution for appropriately small initial data.

  abstract   = {Despite recent advances in both surgery and chemoradiotherapy, mortality rates for advanced cancer remain high. There is a pressing need for novel therapeutic strategies; one option is systemic oncolytic viral therapy. Intravenous administration affords the opportunity to treat both the primary tumour and any metastatic deposits simultaneously. Data from clinical trials have shown that oncolytic viruses can be systemically delivered safely with limited toxicity but the results are equivocal in terms of efficacy, particularly when delivered with adjuvant chemotherapy. A key reason for this is the rapid clearance of the viruses from the circulation before they reach their targets. This phenomenon is mainly mediated through neutralising antibodies, complement activation, antiviral cytokines, and tissue-resident macrophages, as well as nonspecific uptake by other tissues such as the lung, liver and spleen, and suboptimal viral escape from the vascular compartment. A range of methods have been reported in the literature, which are designed to overcome these hurdles in preclinical models. In this paper, the potential advantages of, and obstacles to, successful systemic delivery of oncolytic viruses are discussed. The next stage of development will be the commencement of clinical trials combining these novel approaches for overcoming the barriers with systemically delivered oncolytic viruses.},

  abstract = {Given two mixed norm Lebesgue spaces on an -fold product of arbitrary -finite measure spaces, is one contained in the other? If so, what is the norm of the inclusion map? These questions are answered completely for a large range of Lebesgue indices and all measure spaces. When the measure spaces are atomless, both questions are settled for all indices. When the measure spaces are not purely atomic, the first question is settled for all indices. Some complete and some partial results are given in the remaining cases, but a wide variety of behaviour is observed. In particular, the norm problem for purely atomic measure spaces is seen to be intractable for certain ranges of the Lebesgue indices; it is equivalent to an optimization problem that includes a known NP-hard problem as a special case.},

  abstract  = {In this paper, we deal with a chemotaxis-haptotaxis model with re-establishment effect. We consider this problem in a bounded domain Ω ⊂ RN(N = 2, 3) with zero-flux boundary conditions. Although the L∞ -norm of the extracellular matrix density ω is easy to be obtained, the re-establishment mechanism still cause essential difficulty due to the deficiency of regularity for ω. We use some iterative techniques to establish the W1,∞ bound of uPA protease concentration v, and further obtained the L∞ estimate of the cancer cell density u. Using these a prior estimates, we finally established the existence of global-in-time classical solution, which is bounded uniformly. The result of this paper fills the gap of [Pang and Wang, J. Differential Equations 263 (2017) 1269–1292; Tao and Winkler, J. Differential Equations 257 (2014) 784–815] in dimension 2 with q = 1, in [Tao and Winkler, J. Differential Equations 257 (2014) 784–815], the boundedness of the solution is left open; and in [Pang and Wang, J. Differential Equations 263 (2017) 1269–1292], the global existence and boundedness is established only for large μ. In particular, the global solvability and boundedness of smooth solutions in dimension 3 has never been touched before, this paper is the first attempt to solve this problem. © 2018 London Mathematical Society},

  abstract = {Reaction–diffusion processes occur in a wide variety of physical and biological settings. When the saturation of the diffusion flux, as is to be expected of a physical process at high gradients, is incorporated into these processes, it may cause a fundamental change in the ensuing morphology, since now not only discontinuous equilibria become admissible, but they may emerge instead of travelling waves (TWs). A class of such processes, modelled by the equation ut = [Q(ux)]x − β2f(u), is studied both analytically and numerically. The diffusion flux Q is assumed to be a bounded increasing function with a sufficiently fast saturation rate, β {\textgreater} 0 is a constant, and a typical f(u) ≡ f(u; α1, …, αN) with f(0; ·) = f(1; ·) = f(αi; ·) = 0, i = 1, …, N has a sequence of control parameters αi ∊ (0, 1). We show that the conventional equilibria kinks connecting upstream with downstream states may, when the parameter β exceeds a critical threshold, have a discontinuous part. Moreover, while in the conventional case of a linear Q when the total reaction is nonzero TWs form, a bounded Q enables discontinuous equilibria, provided β is sufficiently large. Remarkably, when the number of possible constant equilibria is greater than two, the pattern may admit more than one discontinuity. Uniqueness of such states depends on the class of initial data assumed. We also numerically demonstrate that these new equilibria are robust and are (strong) attractors for a wide class of initial data.},
