  abstract         = {We study the blow-up asymptotics of radially decreasing solutions of the
   parabolic-elliptic Keller-Segel-Patlak system in space dimensions n3. In
   view of the biological background of this system and of its mass
   conservation property, blowup is usually interpreted as a phenomenon of
   concentration or aggregation of the bacterial population. Understanding
   the asymptotic behavior of solutions at the blowup time is thus
   meaningful for the interpretation of the model. Under mild assumptions
   on the initial data, for n3, we show that the final profile satisfies
   C1|x|-2u(x,T)C2|x|-2, with convergence in L-1 as tT.This is in sharp
   contrast with the two-dimensional case, where solutions are known to
   concentrate to a Dirac mass at the origin (plus an integrable part). We
   also obtain refined space-time estimates of the form u(x, t)
   C(T-t+|x|(2))(-1) for type I blowup solutions. Previous work had shown
   that radial, self-similar blowup solutions (which satisfy the above
   estimates) exist in dimensions n3 and do not exist in dimension 2. Our
   results thus reveal that the final profile displayed by these special
   solutions actually corresponds to a much more general phenomenon.},

  abstract         = {We consider an elliptic–parabolic system of the Keller–Segel type which involves nonlinear diffusion. We find a critical exponent of the nonlinearity in the diffusion, measuring the strength of diffusion at points of high (population) densities, which distinguishes between finite-time blow-up and global-in-time existence of uniformly bounded solutions. This critical exponent depends on the space dimension n ⩾ 1, where apart from the physically relevant cases n = 2 and n = 3 also the result obtained in the one-dimensional setting might be of mathematical interest: here, namely, finite-time explosion of solutions occurs although the Lyapunov functional associated with the system is bounded from below. Additionally this one-dimensional case is an example to show that L∞ estimates of solutions to non-uniformly parabolic drift–diffusion equations cannot be expected even when boundedness of the gradient of the drift term is presupposed.},

In particular, we consider the system in a bounded domain of two-dimensional Euclidean space. In that situation, we can find solutions to the system that blow up in finite time. Then, these solutions become the sum of an L1-function and delta functions at the blowup time.
   "As regards the blowup speed, there exists a radial solution whose blowup speed is greater than that of backward self-similar solutions. We refer to that blowup as Type II blowup. In this paper, we investigate whether finite time blowup solutions to the system exhibit Type II blowup.''},

  abstract         = {We consider a parabolic-parabolic Keller--Segel system in a ball of \$ \mathbb{R}^N \$ under the Neumann boundary condition. This was introduced as a model of aggregation of bacteria. The aggregation is mathematically defined as finite-time blowup. When \$ N = 2 \$, an optimal criterion for finite-time blowup was obtained in [N. Mizoguchi and M. Winkler, Boundedness of Global Solutions in the Two-Dimensional Parabolic Keller--Segel System, preprint]. On the other hand, there has been no criterion for finite-time blowup for \$ N \geq 3 \$ though existence of radial solutions blowing up in finite time was known due to [M. Winkler, J. Math. Pures Appl., 100 (2013), pp. 748--767]. In this paper, focusing on common nature in all dimensions, we give a criterion for finite-time blowup for \$ N = 2, 3, 4 \$.},

  abstract         = {Perhaps the most classical diffusion model for chemotaxis is the Keller-Segel system \begin{equation}\tag{$\ast$} \label{ks0} \left\{ \begin{aligned} u_t =&\; \Delta u - \nabla \cdot(u \nabla v) \quad in {\mathbb R}^2\times(0,\infty),\\ v =&\; (-\Delta_{\R^2})^{-1} u := \frac 1{2\pi} \int_{R^2} \, \log \frac 1{|x-z|}\,u(z,t)\, dz, \\ & \qquad\ u(\cdot ,0) = u_0 \geq 0\quad\hbox{in } R^2. \end{aligned} \right. \end{equation} We consider the {\em critical mass case} $\int_{R^2} u_0(x)\, dx = 8\pi$ which corresponds to the exact threshold between finite-time blow-up and self-similar diffusion towards zero. We find a radial function $u_0^*$ with mass $8\pi$ such that for any initial condition $u_0$ sufficiently close to $u_0^*$ the solution $u(x,t)$ of \equ{ks0} is globally defined and blows-up in infinite time. As $t\to+\infty $ it has the approximate profile $$ u(x,t) \approx \frac 1{\lambda^2} \ch{U}\left (\frac {x-\xi(t)}{\lambda(t)} \right ), \quad \ch{U}(y)= \frac{8}{(1+|y|^2)^2}, $$ where $\lambda(t) \approx \frac c{\sqrt{\log t}}, \ \xi(t)\to q $ for some $c>0$ and $q\in \R^2$. This result answers affirmatively the nonradial stability conjecture raised in \cite{g}.},

We prove that if $ n \geq 7$ and $ u_0 \geq 0$, then any blowup must be of Type I, i.e., \[\|u(\cdot, t)\|_{L^\infty({\mathbb R}^n)}\leq C(T-t)^{-\frac{1}{p-1}}.\] A similar result holds for bounded convex domains. The proof relies on a reverse inner-outer gluing mechanism and delicate analysis of bubbling behavior (bubbling tower/cluster).},
