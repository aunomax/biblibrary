Local assessments of chemical concentrations made by individual cells give rise to fluctuations in path. When averaged over many cells, or a long time interval, a macroscopic flux is derived which is proportional to the chemical gradient. By way of illustration, the coefficients appearing in the macroscopic flux equations are calculated for a particular microscopic model.},

We prove that if $ n \geq 7$ and $ u_0 \geq 0$, then any blowup must be of Type I, i.e., \[\|u(\cdot, t)\|_{L^\infty({\mathbb R}^n)}\leq C(T-t)^{-\frac{1}{p-1}}.\] A similar result holds for bounded convex domains. The proof relies on a reverse inner-outer gluing mechanism and delicate analysis of bubbling behavior (bubbling tower/cluster).},
