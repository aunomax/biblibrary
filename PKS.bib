  abstract         = {Bacteria in biofilms secrete potassium ions to attract free swimming cells. However, the basis of chemotaxis to potassium remains poorly understood. Here, using a microfluidic device, we found that \textit{Escherichia coli} can rapidly accumulate in regions of high potassium concentration on the order of millimoles. Using a bead assay, we measured the dynamic response of individual flagellar motors to stepwise changes in potassium concentration, finding that the response resulted from the chemotaxis signaling pathway. To characterize the chemotactic response to potassium, we measured the dose–response curve and adaptation kinetics via an Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) assay, finding that the chemotaxis pathway exhibited a sensitive response and fast adaptation to potassium. We further found that the two major chemoreceptors Tar and Tsr respond differently to potassium. Tar receptors exhibit a biphasic response, whereas Tsr receptors respond to potassium as an attractant. These different responses were consistent with the responses of the two receptors to intracellular pH changes. The sensitive response and fast adaptation allow bacteria to sense and localize small changes in potassium concentration. The differential responses of Tar and Tsr receptors to potassium suggest that cells at different growth stages respond differently to potassium and may have different requirements for potassium.},

We prove that if $ n \geq 7$ and $ u_0 \geq 0$, then any blowup must be of Type I, i.e., \[\|u(\cdot, t)\|_{L^\infty({\mathbb R}^n)}\leq C(T-t)^{-\frac{1}{p-1}}.\] A similar result holds for bounded convex domains. The proof relies on a reverse inner-outer gluing mechanism and delicate analysis of bubbling behavior (bubbling tower/cluster).},
